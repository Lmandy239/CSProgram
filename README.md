# Project Three - Corner Grocer 

# Summary
Final project that simulates a store's inventory system. 
The application will read a list from an input file, track the frequency or times an item is repeated, and allow users to interact with said data in some additional ways. 

## Instructions
    - Compile the code: g++ -o corner_grocer main.cpp Grocery.cpp
    - Run the program: ./corner_grocer
    - Follow the Interactive menu options (1,2,3) to interact with the inventory
    - Press 4 to end program
    - Program comes with a backup file that has all the frequencies stored. 

## Note
    - Any other inventory file can be added, simply replace the name of the current one in the main method.

# What did I do well?
One of the things I take the most pride on was the implementation of the maps to store item frequencies. This saved me a lot of "forced" coding and allowed for a fast and efficient program. Implementing maps required me to understand the section 11.4 in Zybooks. 

# What can be enhanced? How would the improvements make the code more efficient, secure, etc?
Error handling and user input validation could be enhanced. I was short on time and couldnt precisely test everything against all sorts of inputs. This is something that bugs me as I'm used to applying a TDD process using JUnit on Java programs. However, I still havent learned how to run test cases on C++ thus I felt as if that was something that needed improvement. 

# What was challenging? What tools and/or resources am I adding to my support network?
The most challenging part was getting the syntax right for the maps, but I was able to overcome this with the help of ZyBooks, StackOverflow, and some YouTube videos. With that being said, understanding the gist of the project was also very challenging. I found it very abstract and not explicit enough, nevertheless, the professor was a great resource that I also made use of. 

# What skills from this project will be particulary transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I think most of the following skills will be extremely useful when creating more object oriented programs:

- Separation of conncerns (Modular programming).
- File I/O Operations.
- More advanced data structures such as maps.
- Ability to research and think outside the box. 
- UI Design. 
- Class implemenation
- knowledge of objects.
