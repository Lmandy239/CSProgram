# Project Three - The Gaming Room

## Summary
This project was a software design template for a hypothetical scenario where I worked for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a technology consultant. In this scenario, CTS has taken a new client named The Gaming Room. This client aims to develop a web-based cross-platform game that is based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It.

Specifically, the staff of The Gaming Room needed assistance in setting up the environment to facilitate the development of the web-based version of the gaming app. Thus, my job was to create a software design document that addressed all their software requirements.

The client had a set of initial requirements that later increased or changed as a result of the software application decisions.

## What Did I Do Well?
One of the most solid parts of my project was my clear and concise executive summary. This summary clearly outlined the project while keeping things simple and without overcomplicating any aspects. It was direct, used common language, and addressed all the needs of the client. The requirements were all stated and further divided into functional and non-functional requirements. This separation of concerns is what I believe would ensure that all stakeholders understood the scope and needs of the project.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code
I found that during the early stages, the domain model is extremely efficient in helping develop code. This is because a UML diagram is where one can properly plan the classes, apply OOP principles, and create a structure or blueprint for the future code. However, another part of the process that I found helpful when developing code was the executive summary portion. This is because "dumbing down" a project and using simple words to explain it helps create a better mental image of it. Furthermore, this puts it into perspective and lets one know exactly what they should be coding. In essence, writing problems in English before writing them in code is a great way to breakdown problems.


## What would I revise and how could it be improved?

While the evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each operating platform (Linux, Mac, Windows) and mobile devices meets the clients criteria, I believe it could be revised and somewhat enhanced. There is a limitation that stems from the lack of class material on this subject, as well as my lack of experience with these platforms. These two factors impacted the depth of analysis provided. The course did not provide enough resources or cover some platforms in sufficient detail to properly address the sections posed.

In an ideal scenario, I would improve this section by incorporating more comprehensive knowledge and specifications from specific platform-related documentation. This would involve conducting having access to the right documentation in order to provide the best possible evaluation for the client. 

## How did I interpret the user’s needs and implement them into my software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
In this scenario, all I had to do was objectively follow the user's needs that The Gaming Room needed me to address. However, I took liberties to add, enhance, and improve these needs. This liberty came from prior experience creating applications as well as knowledge on the best approaches to creating a user-friendly application. This process involved understanding mechanics and identifying how to best translate them into a multi-platfrom environment. Additionally, one factor that remained a priority was the users safety and security. These sorts of needs are important because they directly impact their satisfaction. Without a satisfied user, there is no revenue or profit for the company. Therefore, a design that aligns with users needs and expectations will ultimately contribute to the success of the application. Overall, if the user feels as if the company takes care of their needs, then they'll be more likely to continue to support the brand

## How did I approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would I use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach to designing software for The Gaming Room was systematic and user-centered. I began by collecting all the requirements and setting up an engaging evaluation. This was extremely useful in clarifying objectives and limitations. Then, I finished the UML diagram by properly mapping out the functionality while ensuring all interactions were properly depicted. Lastly, I used my knowledge of different operation platforms to create an evaluation table from which I'd recommend the best platform for the project. This recommendation took into account things such as security, server-side development, client-side development, memory management, and storage management.


I think there isn't much to improve in the near future. In the real world, perhaps an agile approach would be used in conjunction with a template such as this. However, the techniques and strategies will vary depending on my company's standards as well as the clients needs. The one thing I believe should remain the same is always remembering to mention a test-driven developmental approach.

## Conclusion
The Gaming Room project was a rewarding experience that not only tested my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of understanding user needs in software design. Moving forward, I aim to apply these lessons in future projects to create even more effective and user-friendly applications.
